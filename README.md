# TakumiBC (my slave)

## What is it?

- TakumiBC is a anthropogenic (human-like) AI to help you create nonexistent tools such as finding yourself a fake girlfriend.
- TakumiBC has been praised by many:
    - Linus Torvalds:
        > Many AI companies have been especially hard to deal with.
        >
        > Especially Nvidia, who also makes chips, a lot of chips, selling them into the Android market.
        >
        > It's really sad, and I really want to fuck those companies.
        >
        > However, with the arrival of TakumiBC, I can proudly say that I have a fake girlfriend to "target" instead of these companies.
    - Robert E. Lee:
        > TakumiBC is quite a peculiar slave. He's not really... black.
        >
        > However, he definitely is the most hardworking out of all of them I own.
        >
        > He doesn't even cry if I belt him or racially abuse him!
    - My cat:
        > Meow.
        > (TakumiBC is the best slave I've ever owned!)
    - [Thomas Wu](https://github.com/TakumiBC):
